       <p class="vocab-text"><strong>Homophones</strong> are words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. These words may be spelled differently from each other ,<br />(such as to, too, and two), or they may be spelled the same way (as in quail meaning ‘to cower’ and quail meaning a type of bird). <br />
          <strong>Homographs</strong> are words that are spelled alike but are different in meaning or derivation or pronunciation. Sometimes these words sound different <br />(as in the bow of a ship, and the bow that shoots arrows), and sometimes these words sound the same (as in quail meaning ‘to cower’ and quail meaning a type of bird).<br />
          <strong>Homonym</strong> may be used to refer to either homophones or to homographs. Some people feel that the use of homonym should be restricted to words <br /> that are spelled alike but are different in pronunciation and meaning, such as the bow of a ship and the bow that shoots arrows.</p>

                <p class="vocab-definitions">A <i>dairy</i> is a business enterprise established for the harvesting or processing (or both) of animal milk – mostly from cows or buffaloes, but also from goats, sheep, horses, or camels – for human consumption.
                 A dairy is typically located on a dedicated dairy farm and milk or in a section of a multi-purpose farm (mixed farm) that is concerned with the harvesting of milk.
                 As an attributive, the word dairy refers to milk-based products, derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production: for example dairy cattle, dairy goat. 
                 A dairy farm produces milk and a dairy factory processes it into a variety of dairy products. 
            <br /> <br>
               A <i>diary</i> is a written or audiovisual record with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. 
                Diaries have traditionally been handwritten but are now also often digital. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. 
                Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. Hansard), business ledgers, and military records. 
                In British English, the word may also denote a preprinted journal format.
                Today the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. 
                The word "journal" may be sometimes used for "diary," but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries (from the Latin word for 'day'), whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.[citation needed]
                Although a diary may provide information for a memoir, autobiography or biography, it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. 
                By extension, the term diary is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary.
